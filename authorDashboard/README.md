Author Dashboard
================

How to Use
----------
This is an example of two dashboard elements powered by the Parse.ly API:

  # a historical histogram of page views data for a particular author.
  # a list of the author's top posts, sorted by page views.

What's included?
----------------
  * creds.js - this file contains a structure for providing apikey and secret.
  * fully_client_side.html - this file uses the apikey and secret to make requests to the analytics endpoint.
  Note: providing the secret to the browser is not a recommended approach unless it is acceptable for page views and other metrics data to be accessible to others.
